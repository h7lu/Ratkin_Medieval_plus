    RkM: Base/abstract teaching ritual precept.
    NOTES / assumptions:
    - This precept is marked abstract so it won't produce ConfigErrors if a ritualPatternBase
      isn't chosen yet. Change abstract to "false" and set ritualPatternBase to a concrete
      RitualPatternDef (from Core or Odyssey) when you pick which pattern to use.
    - Role ids used by the planned worker: "teacher" and "student". You can rename them
      later to match whichever RitualPattern/RitualBehavior you choose.
